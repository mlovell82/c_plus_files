My most called function was my destructor [~String()].  I used it on log._3_medium.txt because I was never able to get log_4_.txt to work.  My destructor was called 27388 times, and the next closest was my default constructor 11,596 times.  This makes sense that default would be the most common called because no matter which way a String object was constructed they all are destructed with the same method.
